Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the booth into the mirror
Felt like summer
To my December
Was it my August?
Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, it's so comedic
At least I had it (uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone (two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I know love is all I got
I just hope to god she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)
Kept it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)
Keep it going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (going)
And now I'm scarred for life
My love is gone (gone), my love is gone (gone)
My love is gone (it's gone), my love is gone
